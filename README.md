# beep
a small program that randomly emits a beep between 7 and 17 seconds. This has no practical value.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLATION:
1.) After downloading the ZIP file, open it and use the setup wizard to install the program.
2.) Open the folder in which you downloaded it and click on the application named "beep".
3.) The application will open a window: you may close this, the program will run without it open.

STOPPING THE PROGRAM:
1.) Open Windows Task Manager and navigate to the Processes tab.
2.) Find the process named "beep.exe" and click on it, then click on the "end process" button.
3.) To get the program running again, simply open the folder in which you downloaded it in and click on the beep button

CHANGING THE SOUND:
1.) By default, the program plays an error sound. To change the sound, simply add a .WAV file (not any other file format) named "noise.wav" into the folder where beep is installed.
2.) Run the program - your new sound should play.

UNINSTALLING THE PROGRAM:
1.) Go to the ZIP file you downloaded to install the program, and open the installer. When you run the installer, you will get an option to unistall the program.

Enjoy!
